# A Methodology for Finding the Convergence Research Area by Measuring Convergence Index 
- **Abstract:** In conjunction with securing R&D competitiveness through technology convergence, there is a growing interest in the strategy to derive innovation based on the measurement of convergence. In this paper, we present a data-based model that suggests convergence strategies for the research projects of government research institutes (GRIs) in Korea. The convergence characteristics of the research projects are represented by inherent attributes of technology and behavioral attributes of actors. The measuring process of the proxy variables (Rao-Stirling and Herfindahl-Hirschman Indices) for each attributes are proposed. These two indices are used to construct the convergence diagram, through which the research projects of GRIs are distributed into four areas: Alliance- Intra, Alliance-Inter, Competition, Mission-Oriented. Based on the convergence diagram proposed in this study the convergence index is measured to derive 30 convergence research areas of GRIs. As a result, we expect to provide appropriate guidelines for setting the policy direction of the convergence research projects.
